        <p>Hello, My name is Natalie, I am a full-stack software engineer. I started my career off in sales and transitioned to tech because I find programming to be an interesting career.  
            My goal is to develop as a software engineer and increase my knowledge of the tech industry. This web page is to showcase my work throughout my time as a Junior Developer, and to keep adding to showcase my work. I hope you enjoy looking at my projects.
